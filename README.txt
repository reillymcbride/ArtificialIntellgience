This folder contains the code for the assignements I completed during Artificial Intelligence I & II
during my Junior year at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Some write-ups and 
data files are also included.

The code represents pretty standard AI problems--nQueens, TicTacToe, Othello (an interclass competition
for us), etc.

Locations of some algorithms of interest:
Minimax: Othello/strategy.py and TicTacToe/TicTacToe.py
Alpha-beta pruning: Othello/strategy.py
Greedy: 15puzzle.py
DFS & BFS: DFSBFS.py

I have continued to use Python since taking AI, most notably in my current summer internship, in which
I have been using Pandas to write scripts to read in, analyze, and output patient data. I am happy
to discuss that work more individually.
